## About

Suki is a [Paper](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper) server fork for SuCraft, a survival server since August 2011. As such, it must be stable and high performance.

Suki is a direct fork of [Mirai](https://github.com/etil2jz/Mirai), which includes various reasonably stable improvements from [Pufferfish](https://github.com/pufferfish-gg/Pufferfish), [Petal](https://github.com/Bloom-host/Petal), [Lithium](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric) and more. To maintain stability, Suki may not always update from upstream right away if changes to Mirai have not been tested.

Suki adds unique performance mechanics specially geared towards getting the most out of your hardware for a community server.

&#10141; **See [Quick setup](https://github.com/SuCraft/Suki/wiki/Quick-setup) for a quick setup guide, and [Features](https://github.com/SuCraft/Suki/wiki/Features) for details of every feature.**

## Features

<h3>Inherited</h3>

- Fork of **[Mirai](https://github.com/etil2jz/Mirai)**, **[Pufferfish](https://github.com/pufferfish-gg/Pufferfish)** for the best performance.
- Contains **[Lithium](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric)** patches which respect vanilla parity.
- Async pathfinding and multithreaded entity tracker from **[Petal](https://github.com/Bloom-host/Petal)** which drastically reduce entity load.
- Reduced bandwidth consumption and CPU usage from avoiding sending useless packets in certain situations.
- Bug fixes for several Minecraft issues.
- Faster process for vanilla methods.

<h3>Performance</h3>

<ul>
    <b>Very high view distance at low CPU</b> <a href="https://github.com/SuCraft/Suki/wiki/Features#view-distance">(&#10141; Wiki)</a>
    <li>
        Separate view distance for tracked chunks and non-tracked chunks, allowing a view distance of 32 with very low CPU usage.
    </li>
    <li>
        Fairly adapt the maximum view distances of all players automatically based on each player's client view distance and the configured total number of chunks the server can handle.
    </li>
    <li>
        Limit the chunks loaded and sent by the server based on the client view distance.
    </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <b>Faster entity ticking</b> <a href="https://github.com/SuCraft/Suki/wiki/Features#entity-ticking">(&#10141; Wiki)</a>
    <li>
        Skip a custom proportion of active entity ticks. (Paper uses &frac14; by default.)
    </li>
    <li>
        Configurable item pickup frequency for hoppers and villagers. <a href="https://github.com/SuCraft/Suki/wiki/Features#item-pickup">(&#10141; Wiki)</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        Entities are woken up from inactivity with some variance instead of many at the same time.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <b>Accurate async CPU usage</b> <a href="https://github.com/SuCraft/Suki/wiki/Features#accurate-async-cpu-usage">(&#10141; Wiki)</a>
    <li>
    Environment variables that give you full control over the number of CPU cores/threads used for async tasks, such as chunk loading, entity tracking and async plugin tasks.
    </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <b>Smooth networking</b>
    <li>
        Interweave chunk and non-chunk packets based on network conditions, so that heavy world loading under a constrained network does not impact smooth movement and combat. <a href="https://github.com/SuCraft/Suki/wiki/Features#network-constrained-chunk-sending">(&#10141; Wiki)</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        Small important packets are sent without delay.
    </li>
    <li>
        Prevent duplicate block and chunk updates sent over time, preventing FPS loss on the client when there are many recurring block updates such as from moving lights or pistons. <a href="https://github.com/SuCraft/Suki/wiki/Features#prevent-block-update-client-lag">(&#10141; Wiki)</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        Customize keepalive frequency and don't kick players for timing out. <a href="https://github.com/SuCraft/Suki/wiki/Features#keepalive">(&#10141; Wiki)</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        Further reach distance can be accepted from players to prevent block placements failing due to lag. <a href="https://github.com/SuCraft/Suki/wiki/Features#interaction-distance">(&#10141; Wiki)</a>
    </li>
    </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <b>Make up for short TPS dips</b> <a href="https://github.com/SuCraft/Suki/wiki/Features#tps-catchup">(&#10141; Wiki)</a>
    <li>
    Set a custom TPS catch-up time (to temporarily perform ticks faster than 20 TPS after TPS goes below 20).
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Gameplay</h3>

<ul>
    <b>Additions</b>
    <li>
        A debug stick can be used in survival mode for block properties compatible with survival mode, such as changing the visual <code>lit</code> state of a furnace or the rotation of logs or stairs. <a href="https://github.com/SuCraft/Suki/wiki/Features#survival-debug-stick">(&#10141; Wiki)</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        Banners and other items/blocks can be placed directly into the head slot. <a href="https://github.com/SuCraft/Suki/wiki/Features#place-items-directly-into-head-slot">(&#10141; Wiki)</a>
    </li>
    <li>
